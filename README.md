# CS-405-Secure-Coding

This repository showcases the work done in this secure coding course ranging from detecting and preventing certain coding vulnerabilities to creating a seurity policy.

Numeric Overflow Coding displays code that detects when numeric overflow or underflow is about to happen and prevents it.

SQL Injection showcases SQL injection defensive coding solutions.

Buffer Overflow Coding showcases defensive coding solutions towards a buffer overflow.

The Exceptions file showcases the creation of an exception try-block, catching unhandled exceptions, throwing a standard exception, and creating/throwing and catching a custom exception. 

The Test.cpp file showcases the use of Google's unit testing framework to implement 13 unit tests including two negative tests.

Encryption Coding implements XOR-based encryption to encrypt data across a file and then decrypt it.

Static Code Analysis showcases the use of the static analysis tool Cppcheck to scan the source code and analyze any issues/risks.

Project 1 Security Policy showcases principles, coding standards with risk assessment and tools for automation, implementation of automation in the DevSecOps pipeline, and policies for encryption and triple A.

Project two presentation displays the presentation for the security policy along with the script that contains the video presentation.

Journal Portfolio Reflection discusses concepts like not leaving security to the end, adoption of a secure coding standard, and the zero trust framework.
